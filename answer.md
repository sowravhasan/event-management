1. C - Undefined. Because you have declared a variable but didn't assigned a value. This is an empty object.

2. C: "12". Because if you add a number and a string then it will return the value one beside another rather than adding the numbers.

3. A: ['🍕', '🍫', '🥑', '🍔'] . Because the main food array remains unchanged and contains ["🍕", "🍫", "🥑", "🍔"] after adding the info.favoriteFood property to "🍝". Changing the property in the info object doesn't affect the original array.

4. B: Hi there, undefined. Because calling sayHi() without an argument results in undefined being used as name, leading to the output: "Hi there, undefined".

5. C: 3 . Because the count variable is declared to 0, and it's incremented by 1 for each truthy value in the nums array, which includes 1, 2, and 3.
